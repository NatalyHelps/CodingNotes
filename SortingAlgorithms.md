<dt>Bubble Sort: </dt>
<dd>Bubble Sort takes an array of elements and arranges the elements from smallest value to largest. 
This algorithm works by going through elements index by index, stopping and comparing each neighboring indexes, and then swapping the largest values to the right. 
By swapping the largest values to the right, they ultimately 'bubble' to the top.
Smaller elements "sink" to the bottom. 
By default, Bubble Sort sorts elements in ascending order - but it can be directed to do this in descending order as well. (The largest values will move to the left instead.)
This is not the most efficient way for sorting large datasets.<br />
