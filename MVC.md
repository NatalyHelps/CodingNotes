    <summary>Model</summary>
    In the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, the Model is a critical component that represents the data and the business logic of the application. It encapsulates the core functionalities and behaviors related to the application's data, often interacting directly with the database or other data sources.

    <summary>View</summary>
    The View is the component responsible for presenting data to the user and handling how that data is displayed. It is the user interface of the application, and it renders the data from the Model in a way that is understandable and actionable for the user.

    <summary>Controller</summary>
    the Controller is a crucial component responsible for handling user input, updating the Model accordingly, and selecting the appropriate View for rendering to the user. It acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, facilitating the flow of data and interactions within the application.
