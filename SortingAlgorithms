<dt>Bubble Sort: </dt>
<dd>This algorithm gets its name because the largest value is essentially 'bubbling' to the right. Bubble sort takes an array of elements and arranges the elements from smallest 
value to largest. It goes through index by index and compares two positions, and then swaps them if the value on the left is larger than the value on the right. 
The largest value must always be on the left. </dd>
